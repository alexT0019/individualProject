Presentation

Font-style: 無腳字，給人圓潤，不會太多菱角，尖銳的印象
但比較四四方方，而不完全用圓字體，表現比較古板，較靜態的形象
Color: 黑白灰，符合比較沉悶，悲觀personality

#About
tag: margin, font-size較大，eye-catching，emphasize，use heartbeat & fade in animation from animate CSS
biography: <p> -ve margin，閱讀上比較舒適
標題用text-decoration: underline，比較清晰
background color: black and white間住，較不沉悶，清晰分每個section
contact icons: allow immediate contact，可能睇完about就想直接contact，唔洗搵contact page

#Portfolio - Random Quote
Prompt: click to generate -> teach users how to use this website
Container with background image
~random name picker
1. Create variables for elements from other pages(using querySelector)
2. Create array to store random quotes
-> Heart-warming quotes on web
3. Add event listener (click, Math.random)
-> Everytime you click on the container, it displays random value from the array
Reason to create this site: everyone may have a bad time in their lives, may feel depressed or even suffer from mental illness. I hope this can warm their heart and maybe give them some power to continue.
